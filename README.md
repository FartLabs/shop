## Develop locally

- Clone the repository
- Set up Shopify credentials in the `.env`, follows `.env.example`.
- Start the project in local mode:

  ```bash
  deno task start
  ```

## Shopify setup

- Create a new account or use an existing one.
  <https://accounts.shopify.com/store-login>
- Create a new app. https://\<yourshopname>.myshopify.com/admin/settings/apps
- Once your app has been created, select use it. Then select "Storefront API
  integration" link
- Next, check Storefront API access scopes
  - `unauthenticated_read_product_listings` access should be fine to get you
    started.
  - Add more scopes if you require additional permissions.

### Shopify troubleshooting

- If you encounter an error like `error code 401` you likely didn't set this up
  correctly. Revisit your scopes and be sure add at least one test product. Also
  make sure you are using the `Storefront API` and not the `Admin API` as the
  endpoints and scopes are different.
